                        I am a front-end developer. I have acquired the skills of
                        HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Tailwind, CSS, and SHETCN.
                        I am currently building a dedicated repository for myself and with every code I write,
                        I am one step closer to my dreams. No challenge will stop me from reaching my goal.
                        I am achieving my twenty-year-old dream. This is my life and my children's.
