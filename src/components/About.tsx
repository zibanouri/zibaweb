                        I’m a dedicated frontend developer with a deep passion for crafting clean, responsive, and user-centered web experiences.  
                        Balancing the demands of raising two children as a single parent while relentlessly pursuing my career hasn’t been easy  
                        but every challenge has only strengthened my resolve.  
                        Today, I’m working harder than ever to grow my skills, build meaningful projects, and take the next step:  
                        earning a work visa to contribute my talent on a global stage.
